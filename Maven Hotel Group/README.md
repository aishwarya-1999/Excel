## üí°Insights:
1. **High Cancellation Rate During Peak Months:** Cancellations spike during summer, especially in July and August, leading to significant revenue losses (around $1 million in 2016). This suggests a need to adopt strategies that mitigate losses during these months.
2. **Short-Notice Bookings Have Lower Cancellation Rates:** Reservations made within 30 days of arrival have a notably lower cancellation rate (20%) compared to those made more than 30 days in advance (38%). This indicates that short-notice bookings are more reliable.
3. **Higher Revenue Potential for Short-Notice Bookings:** Bookings within 30 days not only have lower cancellation rates but also bring in a higher average daily rate ($191 vs. $169). This presents an opportunity to prioritize short-notice bookings during peak periods.
4. **Opportunity to Overbook During Peak Months:** By selectively overbooking during the summer months, the resort can offset potential revenue losses from cancellations. Replacing advance bookings with short-notice bookings could lead to higher revenue and reduced cancellation risk.
5. **Major Revenue Losses in July and August:** Revenue losses due to cancellations in July and August are substantial, with August alone accounting for up to $1 million in lost revenue in 2016. Targeted action during these months could yield significant financial improvements.
6. **Need for Flexible Booking Policies:** Implementing flexible booking and overbooking policies during the summer could allow the resort to maximize revenue by filling gaps left by canceled reservations while maintaining a high average daily rate.

## üëç Recommendations:
1. **Overbook During Peak Months:** Implement a controlled overbooking strategy in July and August to offset high cancellation rates, focusing on reliable, short-notice bookings with higher revenue potential.
2. **Prioritize Short-Notice Bookings:** Shift marketing efforts to encourage bookings within 30 days of arrival, which have lower cancellation rates and higher average daily rates, maximizing revenue during peak periods.
3. **Adjust Policies and Monitor Impact:** Strengthen cancellation policies for advance bookings, offer flexibility for close-in bookings, and track the impact of these strategies in real time to refine approaches as needed.
